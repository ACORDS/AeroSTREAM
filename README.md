This paper is preprint version of the paper accepted for the publication to CodIT conference 2025.
This paper presents a comparative analysis of
state estimation techniques, SDRE-based Kalman and H-infinity
filters, H∞, within the context of nonlinear systems controlled
via the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework.
While the SDRE-based Kalman filter is effective under Gaussian
noise assumptions, it can underperform in environments
with non-Gaussian disturbances. The SDRE-based H∞ filter,
on the other hand, offers a robust alternative by minimizing
the worst-case estimation error without assuming any noise
statistics. To evaluate both filters, we conduct simulation studies
on two real-world scenarios: temperature control in a data center
and interference mitigation in a wireless cellular network.
Results demonstrate that the H∞ filter outperforms its Kalman
counterpart in the presence of non-Gaussian noise, validating
its suitability for robust estimation in practical applications.
