Paper: SDRE-Based Estimation and Control: A Comparative Study of Kalman
and H-infinity Filters in Nonlinear Systems
(accepted for the publication at the CodIT 2025)
Absract:
This paper presents a comparative analysis of
state estimation techniques, SDRE-based Kalman and H-infinity
filters, H∞, within the context of nonlinear systems controlled
via the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework.
While the SDRE-based Kalman filter is effective under Gaussian
noise assumptions, it can underperform in environments
with non-Gaussian disturbances. The SDRE-based H∞ filter,
on the other hand, offers a robust alternative by minimizing
the worst-case estimation error without assuming any noise
statistics. To evaluate both filters, we conduct simulation studies
on two real-world scenarios: temperature control in a data center
and interference mitigation in a wireless cellular network.
Results demonstrate that the H∞ filter outperforms its Kalman
counterpart in the presence of non-Gaussian noise, validating
its suitability for robust estimation in practical applications.


Paper: Optimal Robustification of Linear Quadratic Regulator

(published at the CodIT 2024)

Absract:
This paper presents a robust control design for
linear systems with matched external disturbances based on
linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and sliding mode control
(SMC). The design includes a quadratic integral sliding manifold
for which LQR is equivalent control, so it does not
force the system to change its optimal dynamics during the
transient response like in other commonly used state-of-the-art
SMC design procedures. The simulation study suggests that the
proposed control design robustifies optimal LQR with minimal
deterioration of optimality.
