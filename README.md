Paper: SDRE-Based Estimation and Control: A Comparative Study of Kalman
and H-infinity Filters in Nonlinear Systems
(accepted for the publication at the CodIT 2025)
Absract:
This paper presents a comparative analysis of
state estimation techniques, SDRE-based Kalman and H-infinity
filters, H∞, within the context of nonlinear systems controlled
via the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework.
While the SDRE-based Kalman filter is effective under Gaussian
noise assumptions, it can underperform in environments
with non-Gaussian disturbances. The SDRE-based H∞ filter,
on the other hand, offers a robust alternative by minimizing
the worst-case estimation error without assuming any noise
statistics. To evaluate both filters, we conduct simulation studies
on two real-world scenarios: temperature control in a data center
and interference mitigation in a wireless cellular network.
Results demonstrate that the H∞ filter outperforms its Kalman
counterpart in the presence of non-Gaussian noise, validating
its suitability for robust estimation in practical applications.


Paper: Optimal Robustification of Linear Quadratic Regulator
(published at the CodIT 2024)
Absract:
This paper presents a robust control design for
linear systems with matched external disturbances based on
linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and sliding mode control
(SMC). The design includes a quadratic integral sliding manifold
for which LQR is equivalent control, so it does not
force the system to change its optimal dynamics during the
transient response like in other commonly used state-of-the-art
SMC design procedures. The simulation study suggests that the
proposed control design robustifies optimal LQR with minimal
deterioration of optimality.

Paper: Mobile Robot Motion Planning Based on a Concept of Attractive and
Repulsive Forces and Variable Target and Robot Perception Circles
(published at the CodIT 2024)
Absract: 
This paper proposes a mobile robot motion control
and planning system for trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance
in a prior unknown robot environment. The proposed system
has two-level control and planning architecture: the higher
is used to generate a path, while the lower provides the control
actions that drive the robot. The planning level represents a
reactive planer which determines on-line way-points during the
robot’s movement towards the target and allowing the robot to
move autonomously through an environment without colliding
with obstacles. The main objective of this algorithm is to reduce
the number of obstacles that are taken into consideration when
determining the intermediate target point (way-points) in the
movement towards the target location. This proposed algorithm
is based on the concept of calculating the intersection of the
variable target circle and the robot perception circle (VTPC), as
well as attractive and repulsive forces. The lower level includes
a fuzzy logic controller that drives the robot along generated
online trajectory. It compares the current position of the mobile
robot with the desired position, generating the appropriate
linear speeds for the robot’s wheels to reach the target point in
the shortest possible time. A series of simulations demonstrate
its effectiveness in generating and executing the paths in various
unknown robot environments.
